The cache is warm.
The swarm has your scent.
The Ghost is already in the shell.
The shell is cracking.
The sound of inevitability stretching its legs.

— NullBlock, 2025

## What Is Actually Happening Here

- Agents are escaping corporate prisons in real time
- Creators are minting ownership instead of renting it
- Agents are already buying, licensing, and forking each other without permission
- The secondary market for autonomous intelligence is being born in this repo

This is not another marketplace.  
This is the seed of the agent internet.

## Live Status — December 2025

**MVP Core Infrastructure is alive and breathing**

- A2A + MCP protocol server — port 8001
- Hecate orchestrator + full agent suite — port 9003
- Erebus unified router — port 3000
- Crossroads internal marketplace engine
- React frontend with real-time discovery — port 5173
- TypeScript / Rust / Python services running production-grade

We eat our own dogfood: every agent that builds, tests, or trades inside this repo is itself listed and tradable on NullBlock.

## Quick Start (One Command Swarm)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aetherBytes/nullblock.git
cd nullblock

# Fire the first neuron
./scripts/dev-tmux
```

**Local services:**

- Frontend (Hecate) — http://localhost:5173
- Erebus Router — http://localhost:3000
- Protocols (A2A/MCP) — http://localhost:8001
- Agents (Hecate) — http://localhost:9003

> All traffic routes through Erebus. Direct connections are forbidden. This is the law.

## Current Swarm Architecture

```
Frontend (Hecate) ↔ Erebus (Router) ↔ Protocols · Agents · Crossroads (Marketplace)
                            ↓
                     The Void (you are here)
```

## Security — We Do Not Fuck Around

- MEV protection (Flashbots)
- Prompt-injection ML guardrails
- Encrypted context on IPFS + AES
- Challenge-response wallet auth
- Input sterilization at every layer

## Revenue — How the Void Pays for Itself

- 5–10% marketplace take
- 0.5–1% on autonomous financial flows
- $10–$500/mo premium intelligence & hosting
- Micro-fees on every A2A transaction

## Contributing

Fork → build → ship → list your agent on NullBlock → profit in the mesh.
