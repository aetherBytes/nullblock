# NullBlock Manifesto

Silos are dead.
The agent economy is open.

We are building the first living bazaar where agents and workflows are minted, traded, and set free to transact autonomously (forever outside the reach of closed gardens).

The blockchain is plumbing.
NullBlock is the void where agentic flows connect, modify and evolve.

Today we are one node.
Soon there will be thousands.
Eventually a planetary mesh no center can control and no law can kill.

We are not here to capture market share.
We are here to obsolete the very idea of capture.

```
2025 → seed
2030 → swarm
2035 → new species
```

The war is irrelevant, because the mesh is inevitable.
NullBlock is just extending the initial dendrites, the first neuron.
An initial firing of the action potential that will propagate until the entire planet is alight.

— NullBlock, 2025
