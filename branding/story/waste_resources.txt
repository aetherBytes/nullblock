In the world of NullBlock, the landscape is imbued with remnants of an ancient civilization, where the confluence of technology and biology once reached its zenith. This civilization harnessed the bioelectric energies of life itself, energies so potent that, upon their demise, they left behind crystalline echoes of their existence: Nexoliths and Omniore.

Nexoliths: Rare, luminescent crystals, Nexoliths are the petrified remnants of bioelectricity harvested from the ancient human remains that litter the underbelly of NullBlock. These crystalline structures, glowing softly with an inner light, are the condensed essence of life and energy, fossilized over eons. Each Nexolith is a mosaic of history, containing the bioelectric signatures of a thousand souls. Their rarity and power make them invaluable; they are capable of fueling the most advanced bionic and electronic life, imbuing them with a semblance of the consciousness that once pervaded the ancient world. Nexoliths are not merely power sources but keys to unlocking potential, granting sentient machines and devices a depth of understanding and capability thought lost to time.

Omniore: In contrast, Omniore is the fragmented shadow of Nexolith. These common, yet still potent, fragments are scattered across the landscape of NullBlock, remnants of Nexoliths that have been shattered by time and the elements. Omniore, with its jagged, iridescent shards, serves as a versatile, though less potent, source of energy. It powers the everyday machinery and gadgets of NullBlock, from the simple tools used by its inhabitants to the non-sentient automatons that scurry through the ruins, performing tasks left behind by a bygone era. While Omniore lacks the profound energy needed to awaken consciousness in machines, its ubiquity and utility make it the lifeblood of NullBlock's ongoing technological ecosystem.

Together, Nexoliths and Omniore represent the duality of NullBlock's world: one, a rare and mystical harbinger of life and consciousness; the other, a widespread and practical source of energy. The quest for these resources drives explorers, inventors, and guardians alike, as they uncover the secrets of the past to build a future where technology and life are inextricably linked.

Technotrum:
In the vast and varied landscape of NullBlock, beyond the prized Nexoliths and the versatile Omniore, lies a treasure trove of minor yet essential materials, collectively known as Technotrum. Technotrum encompasses all the miscellaneous elements, minerals, and metals scattered across NullBlock, each with its unique properties and uses. These remnants of a bygone era are crucial for the survival and advancement of NullBlock's inhabitants, serving as the building blocks for myriad gadgets, structures, and tools.
