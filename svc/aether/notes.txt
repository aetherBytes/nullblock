# other cool bots / tools:
Twitter:

X pro - Twitter tracker tool. Seems to be blocked behind premium twitter account? Prob going to get one anyways... 
    - either way... prob best to get something in house for twitter API consumption and creating private data repos for learning.

- Check to see if twitter handles are being re-used / could be indicators of scam / pumps.


- Check wallet address being input on twitter. "enter your wallet address" type tweets. Can we track the heard?

Telegram:
Mugetsu -  Telegram bot that gives stats on :
  - Dex buys, noteworthy holders, etc... worth checking out. 

I check if:

- Coin is bundled
- Held by smart/whale wallets
- Recently renamed Twitter
- If the DEX was paid


- Is the dev / maker selling? How much / dumping?

^^^ mostly scam detection.
